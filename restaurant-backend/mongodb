=============Schema (mongoose.Schema)=============
Think of a Schema as the blueprint or structure of your collection.
It defines the fields, types, default values, required fields, enums, etc.
It does NOT interact with the database by itself.

Example:
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: { type: String, required: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  role: { type: String, default: "customer" }
});


=============Model (mongoose.model)===============
A Model is a JavaScript class that represents a collection in MongoDB.
You use the model to create, read, update, delete documents.
Model connects the schema to the actual database collection.
MongoDB automatically creates the users collection if it doesn’t exist.

Example:
const User = mongoose.model("User", userSchema);

await User.create({ name: "Lakshitha", email: "l@example.com" });
const users = await User.find();

Note:
1) Unique ID (_id)
MongoDB automatically creates _id for every document.
It’s a unique 12-byte ObjectId (hex string) by default.
You don’t need to create it manually.

you can provide your own _id if you want:
EX: await User.create({ _id: "12345", name: "Lakshitha", email: "l@example.com" });

MongoDB will use this _id instead of auto-generating one.
But in real-world apps, it’s recommended to use default ObjectId, because it’s globally unique and optimized.

2) Created and Updated Timestamp
{ timestamps: true } : Automatically adds two fields to each document:createdAt,updatedAt
MongoDB automatically updates updatedAt whenever you modify the document.
You cannot enable only one using this option.
If you want only one, you’d have to create that field manually in the schema.

EX:
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  email: String
}, { timestamps: true });

3) referencing another collection
EX: category: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Category" }
- type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId → the value stored is the unique ID (_id) of a document in another collection.
- ref: "Category" → tells Mongoose that this ID refers to the Category collection.
- This is called a “reference” or “relationship” between collections.
- So every MenuItem belongs to a Category.

If you want multiple categories
Ex: categories: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Category" }]
categories: [{ type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: "Category" }]
Now, a menu item can belong to many categories.
